        <h1>Hi, I'm Marcus</h1>
        <p>
            I’m a software engineer at Oracle. I’m a firm believer that simple 
            processes yields complex results. This outlook has helped me produce 
            elegant solutions without any unnecessary overhead many times over. 
            I'm mostly language/toolset agnostic, but I do find myself generally 
            interested in Go, TypeScript, Node.js/express and React.
            <br /><br />
            Thanks for stopping by! I have some side projects listed here, as 
            well as some other fun things like my setup and recent activity.
            Here is my resume if you would like to learn more. If you are 
            inclined, feel free to drop me a line &#x1F642; 
        </p>

            <h3>mywta - WA state hiking guide and trail finder</h3>
            <p>Even though mywta is one of the first serious projects,
            it still remains to be my favorite to show off and talk about.
            I developed this project while I was working full time in customer
            service and in school full time working on my Web Development AAS-T
            degree. Since no public API is available for the Washington Trails
            Association, I wrote a web scraping algorithm to collect data for 
            over 3,000 hikes that appeared in indexed search results on the WTA
            website. I then developed a beautiful interactive UI with React, 
            google maps and geolocation. Lastly I developed a REST API for the 
            trail data so other engineers can access the trail data.</p>

            <h3>Finals - rumored to be among the best</h3>
            <p>Finals is a music and fashion blog/zine based out of NYC &#38; Seattle. The owner 
            requested that I build a 2000's themed blog with a 1990’s design 
            while still meeting modern day web standards and best practices. 
            I set up a headless CMS with Strapi so the site owners can add users, 
            create blog posts, manage post comments and edit general page 
            imagery and content. Since SEO was important here, I proceeded with
            a jamstack architechre utilizing Next.js's SSR feature for the frontend to consume
            blog data from the Strapi service. Lastly, I configured a CDN with 
            Cloudflare resulting in an enhanced user-experience, faster load 
            times for assets and a reduced server load. The owner was kind
            enough to let me showcase the code for the frontend build.</p>

            <h3>This portfolio</h3>
            <p>Albeit somewhat meta, this seems like a good place to talk about 
            my portfolio that you are currently looking at. I wanted quick but
            beautiful results. Since this is a simple 1 page portfolio site, I decided
            to build it with vanilla HTML and CSS. That said, I do have a CI/CD 
            workflow set up so that any time I push changes to the main branch
            a webhook triggers the repository in the host environment to pull in
            new changes. Saves me the trouble of ssh'ing into my VM and manually
            pulling the changes (or even worse, transferring the source code with 
            scp &#x1f62c;). I thought that was really cool and couldn't resist 
            talking about that here.</p>
